## Overview

**Grok‑3+** is a next-generation research architecture that extends the Grok‑3 language model with cutting-edge innovations in:

- **Scalability** for edge deployment and robotics integration  
- **Safety & Formal Verification** using constraint‑aware inference and SMT logic  
- **Energy Optimization** via FP8 quantization and hardware‑level tuning  
- **Multi‑Agent Collaboration** and deployment-focused Mixture‑of‑Experts routing  
- **Responsible Deployment** with on‑device privacy, interpretability, and auditability

This repository hosts the full research paper, implementation plans, and related artifacts supporting deployment of LLMs in real‑world robotic, embedded, and regulated environments.
